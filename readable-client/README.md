# Projects-CST438

Readable is a bookshelf application built with React allowing users to select and to organize books into specific categories: read, currently reading, or future reads. The project provides an API server and client library that persists information as users interact with the application. In order to launch the application, both server and browser should be running. 

To run the server: 

1) cd to the server directory
2) type node server.js
3) make sure the server is listening for the app

To run the application on browser: 

1) cd to project directory
2) yarn start
